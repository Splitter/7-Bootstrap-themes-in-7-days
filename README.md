# 7-Bootstrap-themes-in-7-days
This started because I wanted to learn bootstrap. And with all the self challenges going around the internet where people do x events in x days I tried learn bootstrap through such a challenge. And I failed miserably at both quanity and the time limit. But I learned alot.

## Some self reflection now that its done.
A challenge like this is NOT a great way to learn something. I quickly got caught up in hacking through things trying to reach the self imposed limits and wasn't taking the time to actually learn and understand. I will say by the end I had recognized the previous fact and slowed down. Took the time to learn, understand and create a better product. 

## My take away from this
A self challenge like this might be good for reenforcing current skills and practicing. But can be counter productive when trying to learn new skills. 




### All that said, it was still a fun little experiment and I did learn alot by the end.
